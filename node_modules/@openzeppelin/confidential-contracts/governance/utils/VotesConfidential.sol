/**
 * @dev A confidential votes contract tracking confidential voting power of accounts over time.
 * It features vote delegation to delegators.

 * This contract keeps a history (checkpoints) of each account's confidential vote power. Confidential
 * voting power can be delegated either by calling the {delegate} function directly, or by providing
 * a signature to be used with {delegateBySig}. Confidential voting power handles can be queried
 * through the public accessors {getVotes} and {getPastVotes} but can only be decrypted by accounts
 * allowed to access them. Ensure that {HandleAccessManager-_validateHandleAllowance} is implemented properly, allowing all 
 * necessary addresses to access voting power handles.
 *
 * By default, voting units does not account for voting power. This makes transfers of underlying
 * voting units cheaper. The downside is that it requires users to delegate to themselves in order
 * to activate checkpoints and have their voting power tracked.
