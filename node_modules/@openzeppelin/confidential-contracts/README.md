**An experimental library for developing on the Zama fhEVM**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository contains unaudited code and is a work in progress. Use at your own risk.

## Overview

This library contains contracts and utilities that utilize the novel features of the Zama fhEVM coprocessor. Contracts take advantage of the FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) capabilities of the coprocessor to perform confidential transactions. See the [documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/confidential-contracts) and the [Zama documentation](https://docs.zama.ai/fhevm) for more details.
